# Getting Started

1. Open your web browser and navigate to `https://<ood-server>/pun/sys/loop`.
2. Sign in using your regular Open OnDemand credentials.
3. Familiarize yourself with the navigation bar:
    - **Projects**, **Downloads**, **Uploads**, and a **Repositories** drop-down (for Dataverse and optional Zenodo) appear from left to right.
    - The **Explore** link toggles a bar where you can paste a DOI or repository URL.
    - On the far right you’ll see links to **Open OnDemand** (which returns you to the main dashboard) and **Restart**.
4. The first time you visit, create project so that you can immediately begin adding downloads.
5. From the Open OnDemand dashboard, use the **Files > OnDemand Loop** menu item (or its configured location) to launch this app. When you’re done in Loop, click the **Open OnDemand** link in the navigation bar to go back to the dashboard.
