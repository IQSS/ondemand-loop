# Introduction

In OnDemand Loop you organize your work in **projects**. Each project holds all downloads from and uploads to a given repository. Projects let you keep related data together and easily switch between different repositories when needed.

With a project active you can:

- **Explore remote repositories** by entering a URL that OnDemand Loop resolves to the appropriate connector.
- **Download files** from a dataset into your cluster workspace.
- **Create upload bundles** to stage local files for sending back to the repository.
- **Browse local files** and monitor the progress of downloads and uploads.

The rest of the User Guide explains each of these actions step by step so you can effectively manage data transfers through OnDemand Loop.
