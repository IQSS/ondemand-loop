# Connectors

Connectors are a key extension point of OnDemand Loop. They abstract repository specific
behaviour so that the core application can support multiple remote repositories
without changing its own code. Dataverse and Zenodo are already implemented with
Dataverse acting as the reference implementation.

Every connector must provide logic for:

* Repository URL identification and parsing
* dataset browsing
* listing files within a dataset
* downloading individual files
* selecting datasets for upload
* uploading files to a dataset

A connector typically contains:

- `actions/` – service objects used by controllers when displaying repository pages.
- `download_connector_processor.rb` – downloads files for the connector.
- `upload_connector_processor.rb` – handles uploading individual files.
- `upload_bundle_connector_processor.rb` – creates and manages upload bundles.
- `display_repo_controller_resolver.rb` – resolves a repository URL into a controller/action inside OnDemand Loop.

Dataverse and Zenodo connectors are included as examples. All connector classes are dynamically loaded using `ConnectorClassDispatcher` so adding a new connector only requires following the same naming conventions.

### Creating a Connector

1. Copy one of the existing connectors (`app/connectors/dataverse` or `app/connectors/zenodo`) as a starting point and update module names.
2. Implement a resolver under `app/services/repo/resolvers/` that can recognise URLs for your repository and return the proper `ConnectorType`.
3. Add controller classes and views under `app/controllers/<connector>` to browse collections and datasets.
4. Provide processor classes implementing the behaviour required by Loop:
    - identify and parse repository URLs
    - browse datasets and list files
    - download individual files
    - select datasets for upload
    - upload files to a dataset
5. Register any additional routes in `config/routes.rb`.

Following these conventions allows Loop to load the connector dynamically and display it in the Repositories menu.
