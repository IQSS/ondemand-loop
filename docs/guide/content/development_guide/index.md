# Development Guide

This section provides everything you need to understand, run, customize, and contribute to the [OnDemand Loop](https://github.com/IQSS/ondemand-loop) application.
Whether you're fixing a bug, extending functionality, or integrating with a new repository, this guide is your entry point.

### Quick Start

Clone the [repository](https://github.com/IQSS/ondemand-loop) and start the local environment using the built-in `Makefile` targets:

```bash
make loop_build
make local_up
```
The `make local_up` command starts the development environment using Docker Compose with local development configuration.
It runs in the foreground, streaming logs from all containers to your terminal.
The shell prompt will not return until you stop the environment manually.

To stop the environment, press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>. This will gracefully shut down all containers.
Alternatively, in another terminal you can run: `make local_down`

Once the containers are running visit [https://localhost:33000/pun/sys/loop](https://localhost:33000/pun/sys/loop) and log in with the test user `ood/ood`.
