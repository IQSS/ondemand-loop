This section provides everything you need to understand, run, customize, and contribute to the OnDemand Loop application.
Whether you're fixing a bug, extending functionality, or integrating with a new repository, this guide is your entry point.

The documentation is organized by topic to help you find what you need quickly:

- [Architecture and Code Structure](architecture.md)  
  Overview of the system design, key components, and how the codebase is organized.

- [Connectors](connectors.md)  
  Details on how OnDemand Loop interacts with external repositories like Dataverse, Figshare, or Zenodo.

- [Creating a Connector](creating_connector.md)  
  Step-by-step instructions to add support for a new remote repository.

- [Local Environment](local_environment.md)

- [Contributing a Change](contributing.md)  
  Best practices and workflow for contributing code or documentation.

- [GitHub Actions](github_actions.md)

Each page is self-contained but builds on shared understanding of the architecture and workflows.
