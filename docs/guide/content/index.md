Welcome to the OnDemand Loop documentation.

[**OnDemand Loop**](https://github.com/IQSS/ondemand-loop) is a companion application to [**Open OnDemand**](https://openondemand.org), designed to streamline the movement of research data between high-performance computing (HPC) clusters and remote repositories such as [**Dataverse**](https://dataverse.org), or [**Zenodo**](https://zenodo.org).

The core goal of OnDemand Loop is to **lower the barrier for non-technical users** to interact with research data repositories. Following the Open OnDemand philosophy, it aims to provide a user-friendly interface for tasks that typically require complex command-line operations or custom scripts. Researchers can upload and download datasets to and from remote repositories directly from their HPC environment with minimal friction.

!!! warning "Beta Notice:"

    *OnDemand Loop* is currently in **Beta** status. While we strive to provide a stable experience, please be aware of the following:

    - You may encounter occasional bugs or incomplete features.
    - User interface and workflow changes may occur without backward compatibility guarantees.
    - Minor UI/UX inconsistencies are expected as the product evolves.
    - We welcome feedback and bug reports to help us improve!

### Sections

This documentation introduces the entire application. It is divided into the following guides:

- [**User Guide**](user_guide/index.md) – how to use the application to transfer files.
- [**Admin Guide**](admin.md) – details on configuring and managing OnDemand Loop.
- [**Installation Guide**](installation.md) – instructions to build and install the application as a Passenger app on a server running Open OnDemand.
- [**Development Guide**](development_guide/index.md) – how to run the application locally, make changes, understand the connector architecture, and create new connectors.

Together, these sections take you from basic usage through administration and development.
