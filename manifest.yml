description: |
  OnDemand Loop is a companion application to Open OnDemand, designed to streamline the movement of research data between high-performance computing (HPC) clusters and remote repositories such as Dataverse, or Zenodo.
  
  The core goal of OnDemand Loop is to lower the barrier for non-technical users to interact with research data repositories. Following the Open OnDemand philosophy, it aims to provide a user-friendly interface for tasks that typically require complex command-line operations or custom scripts. Researchers can upload and download datasets to and from remote repositories directly from their HPC environment with minimal friction.
