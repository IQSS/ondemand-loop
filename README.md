# OnDemand Loop
Welcome to the OnDemand Loop documentation.

[**OnDemand Loop**](https://github.com/IQSS/ondemand-loop) is a companion application to [**Open OnDemand**](https://openondemand.org), designed to streamline the movement of research data between high-performance computing (HPC) clusters and remote repositories such as [**Dataverse**](https://dataverse.org), or [**Zenodo**](https://zenodo.org).

The core goal of OnDemand Loop is to **lower the barrier for non-technical users** to interact with research data repositories. Following the Open OnDemand philosophy, it aims to provide a user-friendly interface for tasks that typically require complex command-line operations or custom scripts. Researchers can upload and download datasets to and from remote repositories directly from their HPC environment with minimal friction.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Beta Notice**
>
> *OnDemand Loop* is currently in **Beta** status. While we strive to provide a stable experience, please be aware of the following:
>
> - You may encounter occasional bugs or incomplete features.
> - User interface and workflow changes may occur without backward compatibility guarantees.
> - Minor UI/UX inconsistencies are expected as the product evolves.
> - We welcome feedback and bug reports to help us improve!
